Baby Monitoring System 👶🔔
A smart baby monitoring solution designed to assist hearing-impaired parents by detecting baby cries and providing immediate alerts through vibration and LED indicators.


🧠 Project Overview
This system employs a sound sensor calibrated to the frequency range of baby cries. Upon detection, it activates a vibration motor and an LED light to notify parents who may not hear the baby's cries.


🎯 Features
Sound Detection: Monitors ambient noise to identify baby cries.

Vibration Alert: Activates a vibration motor to provide tactile feedback.

Visual Indicator: Illuminates an LED to offer a visual cue.

Real-Time Response: Ensures immediate alerts upon detection.


🛠️ Hardware Components
Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)

Sound sensor module (e.g., KY-038)

Vibration motor module

LED indicator

Resistors and connecting wires

Breadboard or PCB for circuit assembly
Medium

🧩 Software
Firmware: Written in C++ using the Arduino IDE.

Main Script: BabyMonitoringSystem.ino

Video Demonstration: BabyMonitoringSystemVideo.mp4
